# Assignment 1 Feedback

- This should make a good project, good work overall, and some outstanding wireframes in particular!
- It's unclear whether it's focused on undergraduates or not... because on the one hand it says "campus foods", which means restaurants on campus.  But on the other hand you have map views that are off campus.  Clarify this a bit... is it limited to campus restaurants only?  Or only restaurants on campus + X km outside of campus?  If it's not limited to campus restaurants or those around campus, how is it targeting undergraduates specifically and not anyone that wants to review restaurants?  (-2)
- Don't put UI specific actions in your task hierarchy like "submit" and "copy the link", use more general verbs like, "select" and "share", etc.  How do restaurants have a "price"?  Meals or items have prices, but not restaurants.  Some subtasks need more breaking down into further subtasks, like "enter restaurant info in form", what restaurant info?  Name, building (location), food category, etc?  These are all subtasks.  (-10)
- UI wireframe discussion would be improved by referencing UI goals by name, e.g. "browse search results without changing the page" -> improved performance, etc.  You do this once with learnability for example, more of this would be better. (-4)
